## Project Overview

The project aims to develop an air quality predictor using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a workflow depicted in the image "aqp_workflow.png" located in the "images" directory. The repository contains various documents and scripts that are essential for the project.

The project overview includes the following key components:

* Data Collection: The project involves gathering air quality data from multiple sources, such as sensors, weather stations, and government databases.

* Data Preprocessing&Backfilling: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. Additionally, historical data is backfilled to ensure a complete dataset for model training.

* FTI Pipeline:
    * Feature Pipeline: The feature pipeline extracts relevant features from the preprocessed data and transforms them into a format suitable for model training.

    * Model Training: The project trains a machine learning model using the processed data to predict air quality levels based on historical data.

    * Batch Inference: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data, providing insights into future air quality levels.
